# Hamming Encode / Decode Simulation #

#### This project was developed to demonstrate how hamming encoding works. The project consists of two functions: Encode will take any number of bits, and encode them into its proper hamming encoding. Decode will take a series of bits that should be already encoded data. Decode will take the series of bits, decode them and check if there is any error. If there is, it will prompt user there is an error with the bits, fix the error, and output the correct encoded word, as well as the decoded word. ####

### Use ###
1. Simply download or clone the repo.
2. Make sure you have python 3 installed and simply run the hamming.py file with python.
